# Task Instructions: React Development and UI Implementation
- Deadline: 48 hours
- The objective of this task is to assess your skills in React (with Next.js as a plus), UI implementation, and routing. It will also evaluate your GitHub workflow and adherence to design precision.

## Requirements
1. UI Implementation:
- Design Source: Follow the UI design provided in the Figma file: [Figma Link].
- Pay close attention to measurements, spacing, and other design details. Precision is key.
- You may export assets from Figma if needed. (Hint: Use Figma's export options for images and icons.)
- Use React to build the UI components. The app should be modular, with components representing distinct parts of the design.

2. Next.js (Optional but a Plus):
- If you are familiar with Next.js, use it for this task.
- Leverage Next.js features like pages for routing and Image for optimized asset handling.

3. About Us Page:
- Design and implement an "About Us" page as part of the application.
- The page should match the overall design style and include at least:
- A brief description of the app or a fictional company.
- Any relevant images or icons (exported from Figma if necessary).
- Contact information (e.g., email, phone, or social links).

4. Routing:
- Use React Router (or Next.js pages for routing if applicable) to enable navigation between the main page and the "About Us" page.
- Ensure a navigation bar or other UI element allows seamless navigation between pages.

5. Styling:
- You may use TailwindCSS, Material-UI (MUI), or any other CSS framework you are comfortable with.
- Ensure responsive design principles are followed. The layout should adapt well to different screen sizes (e.g., using flexbox, grid, or media queries).
- Avoid copying code from online resources. Plagiarism will result in disqualification.

6. Code Quality:
- Write clean, reusable, and maintainable React components.
- Follow best practices for React, including proper state management and props usage.
- Use functional components and React hooks where applicable.

7. GitHub Usage:
- Use GitHub for development.
- Make a minimum of 5 meaningful commits, reflecting the development progress. Each commit should have a clear and descriptive message.
- Submit the GitHub repository link upon completion. If possible, make the site live using GitHub Pages, - Vercel, or similar platforms. (Hint: Check GitHub Pages or Vercel settings for deployment.)

### Submission:
- Submit your completed task as a GitHub repository link.
- If the site is live, include the deployed URL as well.

### Evaluation Criteria:
- Design Precision: How closely the implementation matches the Figma design.
- Code Quality: Clean, semantic, and reusable code with proper use of React (and Next.js if used).
- Routing: Proper navigation between the main page and the "About Us" page.
- Responsiveness: Proper handling of different screen sizes.
- GitHub Workflow: Clear commit history and effective use of GitHub for collaboration.
- Originality: Avoid plagiarism; focus on creating original solutions.
